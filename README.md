<h3>Hi There &#128075 Mai Here</h3>
<p>
  A self-declared software engineer with about 8 years of programming experience.
  I've been working with a wide range of technologies ranging from Embedded Systems with C and C++,
  to Mobile Apps with Kotlin and Flutter and Web Servers with Rust.
</p>
<p>
  I like to consider Rust and Kotlin to be my favorite languages, as I highly value the robustness of a language.
  That being said, I'll gladly use (almost) any other language where appropriate.
</p>

Feel free to to contact me over Discord at *interacsion* for anything tech related!
